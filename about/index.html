<h1>About Shawe</h1>

<section class="about-david">
<p>Hey there! I'm David Shawe, a designer and solo-founder from Northern Ireland. I run a business called Invisible Building. Invisible Building is a design lead company and we specialise in User experience, designing and building digital prototypes, launching no-code MVPs and helping startups use open-source ai to their advantage. We do this and more for a diverse range of clients. Invisible Building focus on three main pillars of work: <a href="">e-commerce</a>, <a href="">startups</a>, and <a href="">tech for good</a>.</p>


<p>In addition to my work at Invisible Building, I also ventured into fintech research by founding <span class="highlight">Sugar Financial Technology</span>, this led me to explore Bitcoin from a designer's perspective. My experience took me through the Catalyst Co-Founders programme and a Royal Academy of Engineering programme, where I developed a prototype tip jar using Bitcoin technology.</p>

<p>I'm also dedicated to my local community, and I co-founded <span class="highlight">Moira Community</span>, an association aimed at fostering collaboration, innovation, and positive change among like-minded individuals for the growth and development of my hometown. Through this project, we're creating a platform for collective growth and improvement that will benefit everyone in the Moira area and beyond.</p>
  
<p>Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in automation, design, code, and no-code projects, working with various companies and teams to bring their vision to life. I'm always eager to take on new challenges, whether it's mentoring young talents through <span class="highlight">CoderDojo</span> or working on cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>


<p>As a designer who loves the energy of startups, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact through technology and design. If you're interested in connecting with a like-minded individual who is passionate about supporting the growth of the Northern Irish startup ecosystem and building tech for good services, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
