Invisible Building is a project that I have been working pretty much since I graduated from Ulster University in 2011. Straight out of univeristy I started looking for work with digital technology. I was a designer that had taught himself to code HTML and CSS layouts and I quickly realised that there was a niche space that would allow me to be hired by design angencies in Belfast as a front-end web developer or a sort of catch all digital web guy for hire. Rather than trade under my own name I wanted to create a brand. I was walking past a brutalist design building one day and decided I was going to call my brand Invisible Building. Ten years later that project has turned into a limited company and we've had successfully completed many projects for many happy customers.
