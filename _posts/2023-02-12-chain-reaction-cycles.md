excerpt: My largest client that I got to work with as Invisible Building was one of Northern Irelands biggest ever success stories. Chain Reaction Cycles started out as a small bike shop named Ballynure Cycles in 1985. Shortly after I started working with the company CRC merged with their largest rivals Wiggle in 2016. After 6 months contracting with CRC I decided to put Invisible Building on hiatus and work for the E-Commerce giant for 3.5 years.
